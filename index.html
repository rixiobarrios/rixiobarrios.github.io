						<h1>Rixio Barrios ~ Web Developer/Software Engineer</h1>
						<p>
                                Hello! I'm Rixio, a software engineer based in Chicago, who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.
                            </p>
                                <p>My Philosophy</p>
                                   The most important moment of your life is now. The most important person in your life is the one you are with now, and the most important activity in your life is the one you are involved with now. Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. The past has no power over the present moment.
                                </p>
                                <p>My Hobbies</p>
                                   Spending time working on little projects around the house on the weekends is a personal favorite. Binge watching. The Chicago cultural center has a free concert every sunday. Sometimes I go on sunday and be surprised by an authentic folk band from Belgium. Meeting my frineds for dinner is also a very nice way to spend an evening. We have a merry bunch when at the bar.
                                </p>
                                <p>My Food</p>
                                   Such a thing as food deserves its own section. Yes, I am very fund of foods and those places that sell them. I also like cooking from time to time.I certaintly have my hand at exprimenting and using ingrediants in creative ways to achieve deliciousness. I certaintly have my hand at exprimenting and using ingrediants in creative ways to achieve deliciousness. I have been fortunate enough to travel to a few places to experioence the culture and their unique cooking. Japan makes great noodles. Spain has great Orchatas and France their amazing wines.
